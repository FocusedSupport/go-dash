go-dash
=======

This is a silly small program that completes the work done by Sam on [go-dash-javadocset](https://github.com/samcday/go-dash-javadocset), which in turn is a go implementation of Kapeli's [javadocset](https://github.com/Kapeli/javadocset)

We are using this to generate [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) docsets as part of our Jenkins build process, without having to find a Mac to dedicate as a Jenkins slave - since Kapeli's tool only runs on MacOSX.
